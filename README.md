# 🚨 Server Failure Detection using Anomaly Detection

This project implements an **unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm** using the Gaussian distribution to identify abnormal server behavior that may indicate potential failures.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Implemented Gaussian-based anomaly detection from scratch
- 🧮 Modeled normal server metrics (CPU load, memory usage, latency, etc.) using univariate and multivariate Gaussian distributions
- 🔍 Detected failing servers by computing probability densities and setting an optimal threshold (epsilon)
- 📊 Evaluated the model on low-dimensional and high-dimensional datasets
